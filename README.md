# pillar-mongodb-wrapper

This is our internal MongoDB wrapper for Python. If you are not an employee of Pillar or its affiliates, feel free to browse the code and use this repo as either inspiration or a base for your own projects. We at Pillar strive for an open source ecosystem and intend to open source much of our internal tooling and libraries.
